# Converter Cyrillic To Latin

## О сервисе

The service is designed specifically for translating a string of text from a Russian layout into an English one. It is aimed at users who use passwords in Russian (encrypted in Russian layout). Such passwords are very convenient: they are easy to remember and look like a set of meaningless Latin letters. But they have one significant drawback - when working from a mobile device, only the English character set is displayed on the screen of a smartphone (or tablet). And to enter a password from Russian words in the English layout, you need to have a computer keyboard in front of your eyes. Use our service to solve this problem. The service changes the layout in the opposite direction, converting Russian words into a set of Latin characters (including special characters: commas, slashes, etc.).
